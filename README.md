Tips for Using a Teachable Machine Platform to Classify Images:


When using a platform like Teachable Machine to build image classification models, consider the following tips:


1. Use a Large and Diverse Dataset
Collect a large number of images for each class you want to train your model to recognize. The more examples the model has to learn from, the better it will be able to accurately classify new, unseen images.


2. Position Images Strategically
In addition to having a diverse dataset, try placing the same image in multiple positions or orientations within your training data. This can help the model learn to recognize the target object or feature regardless of its positioning in the frame.


3. Include Images in Different Situations
Beyond just varying the position of images, also include examples of the same object or class in different real-world situations and environments. This will train the model to recognize the key features of the class, rather than just memorizing specific backgrounds or settings.


By following these tips, you can build robust and effective image classification models using a Teachable Machine platform. A strong, diverse dataset and strategic image positioning and variety will help ensure your model performs well on real-world data.
